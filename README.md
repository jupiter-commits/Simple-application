# Simple application
A very simple web application to use in my DevOps projects

> There is no frameworks used, just vanilla Javascript and Go

To run this app locally:

1. install go in your machine and build with :
``` bash
go run main.go
```
2. make sure port number and API URL are the same as you want in the front end code and back end (port number is 81 to run the app easily without needing permissions)
3. open the ip in your web browser. `http://127.0.0.1/view/example` to view a web page, or check the API endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1/print`
