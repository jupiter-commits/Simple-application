# Simple application
A very simple web application to use in my DevOps projects

> There is no frameworks used, just vanilla Javascript and Go

To run this app locally:

1. install go in your machine and build with :
``` bash
go run main.go
```
2. make sure port number and API URL are the same as you want in the front end code and back end
3. open the ip in your web browser. `http://127.0.0.1/view/example` or `http://127.0.0.1/print`
